Stock Market Analysis usnig C++

## AIM 
The Aim of this project was to conduct market analysis of top 10 Tech stock by market capitalization. I extracted financial data using yahoo finance API and saved the data in a csv file. I used C++ for parsing the data and performed analysis. 

### Market Capitalization
Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Commonly referred to as "market cap," it's calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.


### Simple Moving Average
-  simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.
- A simple moving average is a technical indicator that can aid in determining if an asset price will continue or if it will reverse a bull or bear trend.
- A simple moving average can be enhanced as an exponential moving average (EMA) that is more heavily weighted on recent price action.

### Exponential Moving Average
- The EMA is a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
- Like all moving averages, this technical indicator is used to produce buy and sell signals based on crossovers and divergences from the historical average.
- Traders often use several different EMA lengths, such as 12-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.

### Relative Strength index
- The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and it is often plotted beneath the graph of an assetâ€™s price.
- An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.
